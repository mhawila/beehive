## Introduction
This nodejs application merges two instances of OpenMRS databases into one. It
works by connecting to the two databases and move data from designated source
database into designated destination database. Once run successfully, the
designated destination database will be a merger of the two initial instances.

**Note:**
1. If you still want the original copy of the destination database, then
   you have to create a copy before running this application on it.
2. The assumption is made that the two OpenMRS instances share the same
    metadata (i.e. concepts, forms e.t.c).
3. For the purpose of this implementation, some of the tables are purposely ignored
   (See below for the list of tables included)

## Tables

1. *person*

## Requirements
* nodejs 10+

## Running
Clone the code from github.

`$ git clone https://github.com/mhawila/beehive.git`

Change into the project directory, and create a JSON configuration file called
*config.json* putting the following content.
```javascript
{
    "source": {
        "host": "mysql source host or IP",
        "username": "username",
        "password": "secret",
        "openmrsDb": "openmrs1",
        "location": "unique string to identify location"    //Must be provided.
    },
    "destination": {
        "host": "mysql destination host or IP",
        "username": "username",
        "password": "secret",
        "openmrsDb": "openmrs2"
    },
    "batchSize": 16000,
    "generateNewUuids": false,       //Must be provided.
    "debug": false
}
```
### Explanation of configuration options
* _batchSize_: This is number of records that will be moved at a time.
* _generateNewUuids_: Whether to generate UUIDs or not. If you want to move the
               records with existing UUID which is recommended set this to false
               **note:** This option has to be explicitly provided. Also if chosen the newly
               assigned UUIDs won't correlate with the source records. Mostly used for repetitive
               runs during TESTING. IN production to maintain UUIDs across instances it must be FALSE.
* _debug_: Whether to print debug level statements.

**Note:** Substitute the given values with appropriate values.

Once the configuration file is in place, Install the required dependencies:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Run the application
```shell
$ node --harmony orchestrator.js
```
Running without committing changes to the database (Dry running)
```shell
$ node --harmony orchestrator.js --dry-run
```

### Merge Verification
The application includes a verification process that is run separately once the merging has been completed.
Currently the tables being verified are *person*, *person_attribute*, *person_name*, *person_address*, 
*relationship*, *patient_identifier*, *visit*, *encounter*, *provider*, *program_workflow*, *patient_state*,
*obs*, *gaac*, *gaac_member*. **Also currently this feature is supported on database running on the same instance 
of MySQL**. In order to run this process, run the following command on terminal.

```shell
$ node verify-merge.js
```
